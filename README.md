# NYC 311 Customer Service Request System Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of NYC 311 Customer Service Requests data from 2010 to present.  
The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and insights into complaint creation and resolution trends.

## Dataset
The dataset contains NYC 311 service requests, including complaint creation and closing dates, types of complaints, and more.  
**Note:** Due to file size limitations on GitHub, the original dataset (`Customer Service_Requests_from_2010_to_Present.csv`) is **not included** in this repository. You will need to download it separately from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) or your source.

## Project Structure
- `data/` : Folder for dataset CSV files (excluded from repo due to size).

- `outputs/` : Folder containing output CSV files and plots generated by the notebook.

## How to Use
